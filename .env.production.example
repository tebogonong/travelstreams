# API Configuration (for production - use your deployed API URL)
# Option 1: Deploy API to Vercel/Railway/Render and use that URL
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/api
# API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com

# Option 2: For now, you need to deploy the API server separately
# The MongoDB videos are stored in the database, so you need a backend API
# to stream them. You cannot access MongoDB directly from the browser.

# Temporary: If you don't have a deployed API yet, the app will fall back
# to placeholder videos automatically.
